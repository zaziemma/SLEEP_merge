#SLEEP PHASES,#
##AN ABSTRACT VISUALIZATION OF THE SLEEPING PATTERNS.##

##CONCEPT: SLEEP PHASES AND VISUALIZATION##

Sleep is unconscious, our aim is to make visible something we can’t really experience ourselves, we can just have sensations about what happens to our body and mind.

In our visualization decided to use simple abstract shapes so that the users need to make the connection with reality themselves.

Even if it’s overall a passive experience, an interaction will keep the user engaged.

Usually sleepers pass through five stages:
 
* 1, 2 (Light sleep)
* 3, 4 (deep sleep)
* REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. 

Progressing cyclically, the cycles go from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1.

A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes.

In the three phases our body behaves in different ways: 

In light sleep you drift in and out of sleep and can be awakened easily, muscles and eyes move very suddenly and you have glimpses of clear realistic images. 

In deep sleep there is no eye movement and very low muscle activity, you picture abstract, blurry images. 

In REM sleep, which is the phase where we dream there is absolutely no muscle movement, eyes jerk rapidly and we produce realistic, but unreal images.

We decided to show three behaviors: muscle activity, eye movement and perceived images.

##“SLEEP PHASES” HOW DOES IT WORK##

Our visualization is made of an element (a circle, which represents the sleeping being) that passes through the phases and changes appearance and behaviors. 
It will go from smaller to bigger from the start to the end of “its night of sleep”.
The three behaviors we chose are represented by parts of the circle: the stroke represents the eye movement, the images inside of the circle represent the way we perceive images and the movement represents muscle activity.

Text and a progression bar help the user to understand what is happening and in which phase he is into.

The user can also interact with the visualization moving the mouse: moving the mouse with a certain speed will stop the sleeping cycle.

The interaction is also experienced with sound: disturbing sound plays when the user moves the mouse.

When the sleeping cycle it’s interrupted the stages start back from the first.
